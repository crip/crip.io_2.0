title: NYC Testers Meetup

In the absence of a dedicated software testing meetup community in New York, me and a couple of buds from the business decided to start kickstart a new initiative. We call it [NYC Testers Meetup][1]. It's a community by testers for testers with a focus on the context-driven testing methodology. Our first Meetup was held on 22 September at Huge Inc. in Brooklyn. [Michael Bolton][2] was the keynote speaker then and well over a 100 people showed up for this event. Our next Meetup will be at Viacom premises on Wednesday (12 November) with [Noah Sussman][3] as speaker. If you are in town, feel free to [sign up][4] (only a few spots left!)

This is the start of something good!
