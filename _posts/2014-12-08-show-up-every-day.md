title: Show up every day

<p class="lead">One key to success is "Show up every day". But it doesn't necessarily mean <em>"Show up ALL DAY"</em>. It just means, "Show up". It could take ten minutes. It could take an hour. But if you do it, then you did your showing up for today.</p>

### How can you show up today?

* Connect two people.
* Write every day.
* Share something.
* Send a couple of emails that you've been holding off.
* Take yourself on a date.

So if you were fired yesterday, just show up today. If you have to get something done at work, just show up. If you have to write, just write a paragraph, or write about the people you sent emails to today. If you're sick or someone close to you is very sick then do something that will add a tiny bit to their health.

If you show up every day for 365 days you will look back and be amazed at how much you did, even if it was just one thing a day.

**We made Crip.io â€“ We showed up.**
