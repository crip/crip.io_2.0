title: If You Commit to Nothing, You’ll Be Distracted By Everything

<p class="lead">Ever since information has been easier to share we all have been posting our thoughts on X, Y, and Z. “How to get job X”, “Live longer with Y”, “I lost 10 pounds with Z.” We thrive on reading these articles and trying to life-hack our way to the top.</p>

It’s an information overload - you think you’re learning more than ever but you’re not retaining any of the information since there is such an abundance being consumed. You need to focus on what you’re trying to improve on with moderate information intake and personal action.

Have you ever had a sleepless night after doing a new activity or after focused learning? Those are the times you’re actually retaining what you’ve learned. You’re thinking about what has changed in your life and your brain is literally rewiring itself with its newfound knowledge. Especially if it was after learning something you need to put it into action to reinforce your new beliefs or everything will be lost.

### Do Something. Anything.
To become better at life or a skill in any way just do something, and I mean anything. Stop seeking others’ advice and go outside; you’ll develop your own values and advice. Remember there is no best or worst choice in any situation. Once you grasp that mentality you won’t strive to read all the tips and tricks on something new trying to learn it the fastest or best way.

Don’t let the length of your goals prevent you from starting on them.

<blockquote>
  <p>Never give up on a dream just because of the length of time it will take to accomplish it. The time will pass anyway.</p>
  <em>—H. Jackson Brown</em>
</blockquote>

You have the opportunity to choose a goal that is important to you and the privilege of failing with very little consequence. Because failing makes you smarter and stronger.

Don’t waste that privilege.

_So close your laptop, go outside, create something, stop reading, start doing._
