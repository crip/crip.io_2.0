title: In describing your values you should use verbs over nouns.

<p class="lead">Values have to be verbs. The reason is that values are things you do. Values are things you live by. You cannot <em>do</em> nouns.</p>

You can only *do* verbs. If you look at organizations you see that they have their corporate values on the wall and it says, *innovation, respect, honesty.* Beautiful posters, yet if you have to write honesty on the wall – you have bigger
problems. 

You can't *do* innovation. You can't walk into someone`s office and say *"from now on please, a little more innovation."* You can say – *"look at the world from a different perspective"* instead of innovation. 

Instead of honesty you can say *"do the right thing."* You can hold people accountable to that, you can build measurements around that. But when someone says *"where you honest?"* and you reply *"well, yeah, but it was more profitable"*, you can
sneak around it, whereas when someone says *"did you do the right thing?"* it is a higher standard. 

You have to have **verbs** if you want to *do* them. 

Our values are *"take an unconventional perspective"*, *"keep it simple"*, *"share"*. We believe in sharing everything, sharing ideas, sharing experiences, *"silver line it"*. 

What we mean by that is we find the silver lining in every cloud. The goal is not to fix the things that are broken. The goal is to amplify the things that work. And ultimately one of the long-term goals is *"make long term progress."*

Because it is a stated value and stated way of operating, and it is a verb, we focus on measuring the long term value we can create in the world and not just the short term gains.
