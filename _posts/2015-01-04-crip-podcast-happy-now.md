<p class="lead">Viktor and I decided to go solo sometimes in our podcasts, due to issue that we only can participate together once a week.</p>

In this narrating podcast I would like to talk about how we celebrate the new year to come, but never the present. I believe it's important that we get better at emphasizing the present.

Because it's better to celebrate now, than the upcoming future.
