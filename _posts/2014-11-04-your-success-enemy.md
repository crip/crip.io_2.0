title: Your success enemy

<p class="lead">Each individual person will have his or her own unique definition of what success means for them. To say this would be to say nothing new. What’s important is not recognizing this truth, but upon digesting it, to take out the time to search out what it means for us and then to actually achieve it.</p>

Here are three things we must do if we want meaning in life:

### 1. You need to define what success means in your life…

Like I said before, success can take many different forms. But you need to decide what it means for yourself. The best way to do this is to picture yourself at the end of your life.

Think about being an old man or woman, sitting back and reflecting. When you look back, what do you want to see? What do you want to be able to say? What will matter? When you have lived your life in a way that you can look back and be content, this is what success means to you.

### 2. …And then live your life with that definition in mind

What’s mindblowing is if you actually do this, and look at the end of your life and what really matters, you will see what you prioritize today doesn’t really line up with those end goals.

If we agree that success can only be defined by ourselves, then I think we can also agree that most of the time we pursue a false “success” defined by people in our lives. We have expectations to live up to. We have status markers to live up to.

And when you really step back and look at the life you are living, you realize the choices you are making are to impress people – not bring you closer to what you truly value.

### 3. The enemy of success

What’s the opposite of success? The first word to come to mind is failure. But I don’t think failure should be taken in that context. Failure can often be a step on the way to success. If we are living our lives in a way that matters, like we described above, we are going to fail along the way.

But what keeps us from true success? That’s a better question. What would cause us to look back at our lives when we are old, and think, *‘I haven’t succeeded. I’ve failed?’*

I think the answer goes back to the beginning when we look at our definition of success. I think the most likely source of feeling like we failed is if we look back and see that we spent our greatest efforts trying to live up to the expectations of others.

It all comes back to our definition of success. Failure may not be the worst thing in the world if it’s moving us forward to our long-term goal of success.

The bigger tragedy would be to find success, but then to look back and realize it all meant nothing.

## Here's how you can question your success

#### 1. Be true to yourself

* Ask everyday if you’re living life at its fullest.
* Am I following my heart right now?
* Does this task, job, relationship, matter to me? If no, take actions to change it.

#### 2. Leave no regrets (risk)

* You have a choice: Live in fear or focus on what you want and how to achieve it.
* Risk and regret are tied together.
* Because of the fear of rejection, failure, or uncertainty we die with our dreams unfulfilled, and our stories untold.
* Risk is a major contributor to greater fulfilment.
* Choose the path which will make the best story.

#### 3. Become love

* There’s a fight going on between two wolves inside us: Evil wolf: anger, envy, greed, superiority, regret, fear, empty excuses. Good wolf: peace, love, hope, kindness, humility. Which wolf wins? The one you choose to feed.
* Act with love towards the closest to you. Make loving relationships. A Mercedes won’t come to visit you in hospital.
* Your checkbook is not your success — The people you meet and influence in your life will be your success.

#### 4. Live the moment

* When you are young, 60 years seems like an eternity. But after you have lived them, they are but a moment.
* Don’t focus on the past or future; experience each moment.
* Judge your life less and enjoy it more.
* In order to live fully, you must banish the word “boring” from your dictionary.
* Live in the present; it’s the only moment in which we have any power over.

#### 5. Give more than you take

* Tasks of a human life: to lose ourselves and to find ourselves.
* Losing ourselves is about seeing that we are connected to something much larger, something that had life before us (God, Nature). Yet we are significant because we are part of a larger entity.
* Finding ourselves is about discovering what we love, how to express ourselves, our own voice and calling.
* There’s no better way than to dedicate our life to giving and leaving the world a better place than we found it.
* If you are unhappy, get busy doing something for someone else. If you concentrate on yourself you will be unhappy, but if you focus on helping others you will find happiness. Happiness comes from serving and loving.
* Few will have the greatness to bend history; but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of a generation.
* Putting the lessons into practice
* Knowing is not the problem, we have to put them into practice as well.
* Answers and experimentation: we pay attention and we try things. In the process, we constantly self-connect and refine until we achieve mastery.
* Knowing these lessons will not change your life, living them will.
* Greatest fear at the end of the life was not death but not having lived.
* What we fear at the end is great incompleteness — that we did not do what we were born to do.
* We must choose to live fully so that we don’t have any regrets at the end.
* Try to resist the temptation to judge your life. Rather, ask how I can embrace these secrets more deeply. The judging mind paralyses us by giving us a false sense of perfection or by giving us a deep sense of inadequacy.

So now it’s time to think through the question: **How do you define success?**
