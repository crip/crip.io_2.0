This week weâ€™re joined by Marissa Monera. Marissa is a technical writer at Viacom in New York. She started out as a software developer, but after maternity leave she found it hard to get a job in a fast growing community. So she found a job as a technical writer, and her previous experience and passion for writing game reviews helped her a lot.

#### We talked about (roughly in order):

* [00:18](#t=00:18) Who is Marissa?
* [06:15](#t=06:15) Gaming and game reviewing.
* [11:15](#t=11:15) Marissas first job as a tester.
* [13:44](#t=13:44) Testers and Developers collaboration.
* [32:50](#t=32:50) Gamer gate - What it is, how big is it in US and Sweden?
* [45:46](#t=45:46) Wrapping up.
