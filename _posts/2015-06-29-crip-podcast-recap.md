<p class="lead">It has been pretty quiet from our side in the last 5 months. But the earth is still spinning and we're moving at a pace so fast we're wondering how we got here in one piece.</p>

In this recap podcast, we're just going over what has happened in our lives since our last episode. Love, experiences, lessons learned and plans for the future. 

We'll try to keep up with more episodes in the future and we'll show you just how big Crip will become!

<b>Crip on!</b>
