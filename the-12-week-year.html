  <article class="post-content clearfix">
    <p class="lead">You know it takes sacrifice to be great, in fact I think their number things to sacrifice in order to be great. I don't necessarily agree though that you have to sacrifice family, health or sanity. But the one thing you need to sacrifice, if you're going to be great, if you're really going to achieve your goals is - <strong>comfort</strong>. </p>

<p>Because the reality is if you’re going to to achieve more than you currently have, if you’re going to I raise the level of performance in any area. Then you’re going to have to do things differently and do different things. If you want something you don’t currently have you’re going to have to do something you’re not currently doing. That means different activity, that means change and yet as humans we are wired for comfort. We tend to choose comfort because we like that, there’s a portion of our brain that is really wired for that, it it leads us to choose comfort.</p>

<p>So in the moment of truth when you have these actions that you’re facing on a daily basis it’s really easy to look at those and go - <em>“You know what, I can do that later. I can do that tomorrow”</em> and choose what’s familiar and what’s comfortable in the moment.</p>

<p>Think about that, if there’s new actions in your plan, that means you haven’t done it before. There’s a level of discomfort, there’s some a lack of familiarity with them and there’s some uncertainty about what it’s going to actually create and so at the moment of truth it’s just easier to say - <em>“Well you know, what I’m gonna do what I’ve been doing.”</em> 
But that’s not going to get you the results you need. That’s not going to take you to the next level.</p>

<p>So whatever your goals are a part of your challenge, whether it’s getting back in shape, whether it’s are earning more money, whether it’s improving a relationship. 
There are tactics in your plan, actions in your plan, to help you create that. And actions that you either had taken before or you have’nt been consistent with. You will need to be willing to sacrifice the comfort in the moment you will. You will need to choose those activities over what’s comfortable and what’s familiar in the moment, otherwise you’ll just continue to put it
off. Which means you continue to pour out your goals, you continue to put off living the life you want to live to some point in the future.</p>

<h3 id="herein-lies-the-remarkable-beauty-of-the-12-week-year">Herein lies the remarkable beauty of the “12 week year”</h3>

<p>The “12 week year” will ensure that you never forget about your goals, it will force you to be as productive as an insurance agency in December…not just once, but four times a year.</p>

<p>It keeps your year short enough so that you don’t lose momentum.  It gives you the ability to re-adjust your goals every 12 weeks based on changing circumstances (as it is impossible to know exactly what situations you will encounter in a 12 month year).</p>

<h4 id="what-exactly-is-a-12-week-year">What exactly is a “12 week year?”</h4>

<ul>
  <li>12 Weeks = 12 Calendar Months</li>
  <li>1 Week = 1 Calendar Month</li>
  <li>1 Day = 1 Calendar Week</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me ask you this, if you’re going to be successful this year, can you afford to waste one entire month? Can you have one month without any progress? <strong>Of course not.</strong></p>

<p>So remember, one week is now the equivalent of a month, and it cannot be wasted! Even a day cannot be wasted, as it is now the equivalent of a week.
Every moment counts in a “12 week year!” So forget about twelve month years, filled with slow days, diminutive progress, and countless wasted moments.</p>

<p>You see, I’ve never met a successful person who didn’t value every moment, and I’ve never met an unsuccessful person who did.
To succeed you have to maximize, measure, and monitor the moments; the “12 week year” gives you a system for doing so.</p>

<p>You may ask, “Is a 12 week year the same as having quarterly goals?”</p>

<p>And the answer is a resounding, <strong>“No!”</strong></p>

<p>Each “12 week year” stands on its own, sure it’s part of an overall plan (maybe an 18 month plan), but at the end of each “12 week year” you measure your results based on your goals for that period alone. 
You then make adjustments as necessary, based on the new information that you have discovered, and you begin a new “12 week year” the way you would begin a new calendar year. (You begin your new “12 week year” with critical information about your successes, your failures, and now you can more accurately predict what will occur in the next 12 weeks.)</p>

<h3 id="so-heres-the-task-for-today">So here’s the task for today</h3>

<p>Take a look at the tactics in your plan, the actions around your goals, and what I’d like you to do is intentionally choose to do those, even though they may be difficult, even though they make me uncomfortable. Especially because they’re uncomfortable. It means the only way you’re going to get comfortable with them, is if you start to act on them.</p>

<p>The first couple times you’re doing this it’s still going to be uncomfortable. It’s going to take you doing it over and over and over again to the point where you become competent with it and now becomes part of the way you operate, when it becomes a part of your comfort zone. That’s really the way we take new
ground.</p>

<p>So be tension about that today. Identify the actions in your plan that are the most difficult for you, that maybe you find
yourself shying away from and tackle those first.</p>

<p>And this is a subject we’re not gonna leave here. Stay tuned for our upcoming revivions via videos, text and hopefully podcast.</p>

<p><strong>Have a great day!</strong></p>
