### Our story

Crip.io is the culmination of years spent working passionately with design, development and software testing. Over time, this passion blossomed into this project that will touch nearly every corner of our lives. We founded it on a shared belief that thoughtful design, quality coding, exceptional testing assistance and personal evolution are paramount.

Simply put, we love what we do and we love sharing it with others. It is our hope and dream that Crip.io will continue to grow, improve, and cement itself as a trustworthy resource for aesthetically striking, high quality software and design.

### Our philosophy

We are two professional crips who imagine a world where people wake up every day inspired to go to work and return home at the end of the day feeling fulfilled by the work they do, feeling that they have contributed to something greater than themselves.

We are here to inspire people to change. Because change is never a matter of ability, itâ€™s always a matter of motivation or drive.

An Cripreneur is an Entrepreneur. We therefore work just as hard for a sole proprietorship as a multinational. We get ideas from our strong and effective work. With only one goal: **Our goal**.

### Our motto

> We are all broken; that's how the light gets in.
